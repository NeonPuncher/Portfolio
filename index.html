        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Swen, I am a Semester 4 Media ICT student at Fontys.</p>
        <p>Born on July 12th 2000, living in Son & Breugel a small town near Eindhoven, with 2 sisters, my parents and my dog.</p>

        <p>My interests are being creative and solution driven as well. I like thinking about certain problems that
            I'm encountering throughout my daily life and how to solve them on unique ways. 
            My daily activities include gaming and drawing. For drawing I started working on my own artstyle last year
            making certain drawings with a messasge behind it. This hobby has currently been build out to a small 
            business, where I sell certain clothing with my designs on them. These can be found in the webshop.
        </p>

        <p>My current work interests lies with future technology, like VR / AR. It interests me very much how these 
            products would continue in the future and if they would be more prominent on the market with tripple A 
            game developers making games for virtual reality only, or having the whole side of designing human products 
            focus more on Augmented reality when designing buildings / products etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also very interested in designing my own stuff: drawings, designs, games, code, etc. when working on my own
            projects. I'm always working on a way to improve my work and learn from my mistakes, in both school work and 
            my own work. Currently I want to focus more on my codework, because I still have the feeling I'm somewhat lacking
            in that part.

            I started my small business called 'Swebshirts' back in December of 2019, with my first line of products being hoodie
            with my design 'tag' on it. This was a much requested action after I showed my artwork on social media, and I let the 
            people vote which design should be the first on a hoodie. After a few polls the results came in and most people did want
            the 'tag' design. I decided to go for a hoodie because it was nearing winter times. I knew I wanted arm prints as well,
            but this would bump up the price quite a bit because it is extra printing work.

            The first batch is selling quite well. Altho for further investments and products, I'm firstly figuring out how to set up
            a webshop and have the products shipped and stored on a remote location instead of my own room and me having to deliver them
            myself by hand.
